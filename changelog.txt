INITIAL RELEASE - 1.0.0 (6 Dec 2021)

Dakka Plus is a remodel pack including a number of vehicles with additional equipment + dakka. This will be taking the place of the old "Dakka Improvement Project" for most new content updates, and will take more of a "quality over quantity" approach, with remodels featuring more than just the addition of a machine-gun-or-two. 

To start off, here is the new Dakka Plus content:


===NEW VEHICLES (6):===

POLAND (1): 
 - CS-63 (added KPVT MG + extra hull & turret equipment)

UK (1): 
 - FV4005 (added .30-cal MG + camo netting, extra hull & turret equipment)

USA (1)
 - Concept 1B (added M2 Browning + AN/VSS-1 searchlight + training flares)

USSR (3):
 - Obj. 263 (added KPVT MG + extra hull equipment based on "Delicate Matter")
 - IS-3A (added twin-KPVT mount + IS-3M hull model based on "Montu")
 - ST-I (added DShK MG + improved hull model from 2018 CT files)


===OVERHAULED VEHICLES (2):===

USA: 
 - T110E5 (overhauled twin-MG mount to fix several texture stretching + camouflage scaling issues)
 - AE Phase 1 (overhauled twin-MG mount to fix several texture stretching + camouflage scaling issues)


Secondly, a number of vehicles have been moved here from the Legacy pack:

===LIST OF VEHICLES MOVED TO DAKKA PLUS (14):===

- CZECHOSLOVAKIA (1): Å koda T-27
- FRANCE (1): BDR G1 B
- GERMANY (1): Jagdtiger
- ITALY (2): Progetto 54, Progetto 66
- JAPAN (1): Type 5 Heavy
- POLAND (1): CS-59
- SWEDEN (1): UDES 03
- USA (5): XM551 Sheridan, M48A5 Patton, AE Phase 1, Concept 1B, T28 HTC
- USSR (1): IS-7

The Legacy pack with the original cast of 120+ vehicles can still be downloaded separately, but will not feature new content updates as often. The Plus pack will receive most of the new content going forward.


===OTHER CHANGES:===

- UK: Fixed minor display issue with GSOR 1008 gun/turret body, which caused the paint selector to render strangely in the exterior customization menu
- USA: Fixed minor display issue with Concept 1B gun equipment, which caused the paint selector to render strangely in the exterior customization menu
- USSR: Updated camo tile on IS-3A/ST-I MG mount/ammo box
