An extension of the original "Dakka Improvement Project" mod for World of Tanks, Dakka Plus is a remodel pack including a number of vehicles with extra equipment in addition to the dakka. This will be taking the place of the old mod for new content updates, and mainly features vehicles with more complex remodels than the original set (closer to full-scale remodels).
